# Practices Organizer
Participants of a leadership course that spans two years (and participants are divided in the two of them) will have to Practice for there future role as leaders. A practice is given by one or more participants, to any given group, and there's around 4 practice days a year.

For this purpose this application, which is meant for the course coordinator, will keep track of the way in which participants have been arranged during previous practice sessions, so that every time that a new practice day is coming along the user will be able to see which participants have already worked together, which groups they have already given practices to, and might help finding a more optimal way to organice the day, so that throughout the sessions there will be a more diverse range of groups and other participants that each one gets spanning the duration of the course.
